# rock-vs-mine-prediction

Binary classification model using sonar dataset to classify rocks vs mines.
This project uses a binary classification model to distinguish between sonar signals bounced off **metal cylinders (mines)** and **rock surfaces**, based on the **Sonar dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Built and trained in Google Colab using Python and scikit-learn.


 Problem Statement

The goal is to classify whether a sonar return is from a **rock** or a **mine** using 60 numeric attributes representing energy values at various frequencies.


 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression (Baseline)
- Train-Test Split
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score
